It does three things (the first two of which can also be done with its close cousin, `str_trim()`):\n\n1.  Removes white space at the start of the string,\n2.  Removes white space at the end of the string, and\n3.  Replaces internal white space with a single space.\n\nLet's look at a couple of examples.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(stringr)\nstr_squish(\" this   is my  string   \")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"this is my string\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAbove, you can see that the leading and trailing space is now gone, and the extra spaces in the middle have been reduced to a single space in each instance.\n\nThis also works with other white space characters, such as tabs and new lines.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_squish(\"\\n\\nthis is   another\\t string\\t\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"this is another string\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn addition to removing the leading and trailing white space, the extra spaces and other white space characters in the middle are now single spaces.\n\n## Learn more\n\nWe've pretty much covered the extent of `str_squish()` here, but if you want to learn more about string manipulation with stringr in general, check out the [Strings chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/strings.html) in R for Data Science [@r4ds2e].\n",
