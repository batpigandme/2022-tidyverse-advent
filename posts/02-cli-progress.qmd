The [cli package](https://cli.r-lib.org/) [@cli] provides helpers for developing attractive command line interfaces and output. It has lots of great features worth checking out, but today we're going to talk about one of my favorites: progress bars!

## Tip

This post is just a quick highlight reel, check out cli's progress-bar vignettes for more details:

-   [Introduction to progress bars in cli](https://cli.r-lib.org/articles/progress.html)

-   [Advanced cli progress bars](https://cli.r-lib.org/articles/progress-advanced.html)

## Progress bar basics

To lift straight from the [progress-bar intro vignette](https://cli.r-lib.org/articles/progress.html), adding a progress bar is a three-step/three-function process:

1.  Call [`cli_progress_bar()`](https://cli.r-lib.org/reference/cli_progress_bar.html) to create a progress bar.

2.  Call [`cli_progress_update()`](https://cli.r-lib.org/reference/cli_progress_bar.html) to update it.

3.  Call [`cli_progress_done()`](https://cli.r-lib.org/reference/cli_progress_bar.html) to terminate it.

We'll use these three steps in our pretend cleaning function, below:

```{r}
#| label: basic-progress-bar
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
clean <- function() {
  cli_progress_bar("Cleaning data", total = 100)
  for (i in 1:100) {
    Sys.sleep(5/100)
    cli_progress_update()
  }
  cli_progress_done()
}
```

We created our progress bar with `cli_progress_bar()` on line 2, told it how often to update (after each iteration) with `cli_progress_update()` on line 5, and when to finish with `cli_progress_done()` on line 7.

If we were to run that function, we'd get the following output.

```{r}
#| label: dummy-clean
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: false
clean()
```

![](cli-classic-example.svg){fig-alt="Progress bar that says \"cleaning data\" with a series of boxes that update along with a percentage and an ETA until done."}

## Unknown total

*But what if I don't know how many units total?* Don't worry, there's still a way to show your progress with an [unknown total number of units](https://cli.r-lib.org/articles/progress.html#unknown-total-number-of-units). You can omit the total number from the `cli_progress_bar()` function, and use `force = TRUE` inside of `cli_progress_update()`, as seen on line 8 of the code below.

```{r}
#| label: unknown-units
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
walk_dirs <- function() {
  cli_progress_bar("Walking directories")
  while (TRUE) {
    if (runif(1) < 0.01) break
    Sys.sleep(0.01)
    cli_progress_update()
  }
  cli_progress_update(force = TRUE)
}
walk_dirs()
```

Naturally, the output will look different, since you don't have a known total on which to base your progress percentage.

## Progress without bars

Want to know how your code is going but don't want or need a progress bar along the way? Check out the [`cli_progress_message()`](https://cli.r-lib.org/reference/cli_progress_message.html) and [`cli_progress_step()`](https://cli.r-lib.org/reference/cli_progress_step.html) functions.

`cli_progress_step()` makes use of cli feaatures, such as [`cli_alert()`](https://cli.r-lib.org/reference/cli_alert.html) themes to show colored icons indicating information, success, and danger, and will show you the duration of each step after it's completed.

```{r}
#| label: cli-progress-step
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
f <- function() {
  cli_progress_step("Downloading data")
  Sys.sleep(2)

  cli_progress_step("Importing data")
  Sys.sleep(1)

  cli_progress_step("Cleaning data")
  Sys.sleep(2)

  cli_progress_step("Fitting model")
  Sys.sleep(3)
}
f()
```

![](cli-progress_step_simple-example.svg){fig-alt="Bullets for Downloading data, Importing data, Cleaning data, and Fitting model each of which is preceded by an icon indicating whether or not it is finished and followed by the duration it took when done."}

This is but a paltry sampling of what you can do with the `cli_progress_*()` functions, so be sure to take the time to check out [cli documentation](https://cli.r-lib.org/)!
