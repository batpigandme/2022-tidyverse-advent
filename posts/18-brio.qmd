String encoding in R (or any programming language for that matter) is no simple matter. Kevin Ushey wrote an excellent blog post, [String Encoding and R](https://kevinushey.github.io/blog/2018/02/21/string-encoding-and-r/), that:

The aim of [brio](https://brio.r-lib.org/) [@brio] is to make that practice easier. brio (an initialism for Basic R Input Output) provides functions that always read and write UTF-8 files[^1], and provide more explicit control over line endings.

In addition to providing consistency and control over encoding and line endings, brio's primary functions, [read_lines()](https://brio.r-lib.org/reference/read_lines.html) and [write_lines()](https://brio.r-lib.org/reference/write_lines.html), happen to be faster than their base R and readr equivalents (see the [benchmarks section](https://brio.r-lib.org/#benchmarks)) of the README for data), which is a nice added bonus.

The [brio documentation](https://brio.r-lib.org/) provides details on how to use its full suite of functions, including [drop-in replacements](https://brio.r-lib.org/#drop-ins) for base [`readLines()`](https://brio.r-lib.org/reference/readLines.html) and [`writeLines()`](https://brio.r-lib.org/reference/writeLines.html).

To learn more on encoding and character sets, see the two articles Kevin recommends at the end of [his post on string encoding and R](https://kevinushey.github.io/blog/2018/02/21/string-encoding-and-r/):
