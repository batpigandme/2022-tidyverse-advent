As mentioned in the overview to the [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) package [@stringr], strings might not be the most glamorous part of using R, but they sure do play a big role when it comes to data cleaning.

This will be a quick hit, because [`str_squish()`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_trim.html) is quite simple (but also incredibly helpful, especially with wild-caught data). It does three things (the first two of which can also be done with its close cousin, `str_trim()`):

1.  Removes white space at the start of the string,
2.  Removes white space at the end of the string, and
3.  Replaces internal white space with a single space.

Let's look at a couple of examples.

```{r}
#| label: stringr-lib
library(stringr)
str_squish(" this   is my  string   ")
```

Above, you can see that the leading and trailing space is now gone, and the extra spaces in the middle have been reduced to a single space in each instance.

This also works with other white space characters, such as tabs and new lines.

```{r}
#| label: special-chars
str_squish("\n\nthis is   another\t string\t\n")
```

In addition to removing the leading and trailing white space, the extra spaces and other white space characters in the middle are now single spaces.
