The [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) package [@forcats] provides several functions for [changing the value of factor levels](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#change-value-of-levels)---the most generic being [`fct_recode()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_recode.html), which lets you change factor levels by hand.

[**`fct_collapse()`**](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_collapse.html) is a variant of `fct_recode()` that lets you combine (or _collapse_) a vector of old levels into a new level (rather than specifying the new level for each individual old level, as you'd have to do with `fct_recode()`).

It's a function I use when I want to effectively lower the resolution of my data&mdash;i.e. the original levels are more specific than I need for the purposes of my analysis.[^1]

In this simple example, we'll combine political affiliations (`partyid`) from the General Social Survey dataset ([`gss_cat`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/gss_cat.html)) included in forcats.

```{r}
#| label: libs
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
```

Let's look at the levels we have to begin with:

```{r}
#| label: orig-levels
levels(gss_cat$partyid)
```

Perhaps I just want to know if they're a Republican, Democrat, Independent, or something else--a perfect use case for `fct_collapse()`.

```{r}
#| label: collapse
gss_cat |>
  mutate(
    party_generic = fct_collapse(partyid,
      "Other" = c("No answer", "Don't know", "Other party"),
      "Republican" = c("Strong republican", "Not str republican"),
      "Independent" = c("Independent", "Ind,near dem", "Ind,near rep"),
      "Democrat" = c("Strong democrat", "Not str democrat")
    )
  ) |> 
  count(party_generic)
```

[^1]: For this same reason, I often save my collapsed factor as a new variable so that the finer details are preserved.
